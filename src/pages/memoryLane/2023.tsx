          Analyzing 14 Years of Bikeshare Trips in the United States
        </h3>
        <p className="pt-8 pb-4">
          Many city bikeshares publish data for every single trip taken on their
          bikes, including each trip's start and end locations, and trip
          duration. Through these individual trips, we can analyze the overall
          trends of bikeshare trips in the United States. The visualizations
          below use bikeshare data from 11 major metropolitan areas including:
          Austin, Boston, Chicago, Chattanooga, Columbus, DC, Los Angeles, NYC,
          Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the counts for each city different than what's reported on
          official city websites, which suggests that city officials may be
          using slightly different data than what's publicly published. In all
          cities, we've used what's been published directly by the bikeshare
          system. Some of these systems filter out trips that "are taken by
          staff as they service and inspect the system" and also "any trips that
          were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users
          trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure)" (

            The number of bikeshare trips has increased almost every year since
            the first US bikeshare was introduced in Washington D.C. The
            exception is in 2020, when COVID-19 forced many cities to implement
            social distancing. Since then, bikeshare trips have resumed their
            initial trajectory, reaching 54 million total bike trips in 2023.
