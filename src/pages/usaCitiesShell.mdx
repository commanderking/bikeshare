### Explore US Bikeshare Data for the Past Year!

In the <a href="#shellHeader">terminal</a> below, you can run SQL queries on rideshare data for the past year. All queries are run through <a target="_blank" href="https://duckdb.org/2021/10/29/duckdb-wasm">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, an in browser database that you can query with SQL.

For a list of city files you can query, type:

`.files LIST`

And then query the file directly with SQL:

```
SELECT * FROM 'boston.parquet' LIMIT 100
```

If you'd like to download all data for a city, you can download the parquet files below:

- [Boston](/boston_recent_year.parquet)
- [Chicago](/chicago_recent_year.parquet)
- [DC](/dc_recent_year.parquet)
