# The 2024 Cities Bikeshare Data Quality Ratings

Welcome to the very first bikeshare data quality awards! Twenty city bikeshares unknowingly compete for the crown of having the highest quality bikeshare data. Not a single city invited me to dissect their bikeshare data, but I believe the "true test of a city's character is what data it makes available when no one is watching" (John Wooden - if he had run for city mayor). Let's reward some unsuspecting cities!

## The Rating System

The wheel below shows the six spokes on which we'll be assessing each bikeshare's data.

<div className="w-2/3 m-auto">
  <RadialRank
    data={[
      {
        name: 'Rating Categories',
        accessible: 0,
        complete: 0,
        processable: 0,
        fresh: 0,
        documented: 0,
        unique: 0,
      },
    ]}
    options={{
      hideLegend: true,
    }}
  />
</div>

In order of importance, is the data...

- Complete - Are all critical pieces of info, such as start time, end time, start station, and end station provided?
- Accessible - How simple is it for folks to download the data?
- Processable - How easy is the data to process?
- Fresh - How often is the data updated?
- Documented - How well is variation in the data documented?
- Unique - Are there aspects of the data that should be emulated?

Each category is given a score out of 5, and then given a letter grade based on the following rubric.

| Rating | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | High quality - the data is updated at least monthly and is more than 99.99% complete. The data can be downloaded easily by developers and citizens, and is easy to process once downloaded.                                                           |
| B      | Good quality - the data is updated at least monthly and is more than 95% complete. The data is simple to download, but may require some processing to get the full history of data (merging data structures, handling weird dateteimes or characters) |
| C      | Average quality - the data is updated monthly or upon request, and is more than 90% complete. The data may require significant work to download or process.-                                                                                          |
| D      | Poor quality - The data is considered poor if one or more of the following is true - More than 10% of the data is missing. The data is difficult to download and challenging to process.                                                              |

## Process

To measure a bikeshare's data quality, I processed the data available to create a single file that contained every trip since the bikeshare started operating. This included downloading all the available data, handling any inconsistencies in data betwteen files

- Downloading the available data.
- Merging data into one single parquet file, handling any inconsistencies in data between the files

For comparability between systems, I only included four data points in the final parquet - start station, end station, start time, and end time. Once merged, I analyzed the data to see how many trips had null data for any of the data points. The code for the entire process can be found at: https://github.com/commanderking/citybikeshare.

## Results

Let's first appreciate all these unsuspecting cities for publishing their bikeshare data! Most bikeshares have not done so, and as a result, missed out on this inaugural bikeshare rating.

## Detailed Evaluations

### A Cities

<StatsCard name="Oslo" city="oslo" />
<StatsCard name="Bergen" city="bergen" />

Trip data for Oslo and Bergen are 100% complete. These two cities and Trondheim, are the only three systems that update their data daily. This combination of timeliness and completeness sets Oslo and Bergen a tier above other bikeshare systems worldwide.

Like many bikeshare systems, Oslo City Bike's historical data uses legacy CSV headers that differ from the current format. However, Oslo stands out as the only system that documents when and how these headers changed. To facilitate data processing, Oslo City Bike also provides a separate [CSV file](https://oslobysykkel.no/en/open-data/historical) mapping old legacy station IDs to new ones. Bergen, on the other hand, uses a consistent data structure across all historical records,
making its data even simpler to process.

![Oslo Live Rides](/images/2024_ratings/oslo_live_ride.png)

Norway's bikeshare systems are pioneers in providing **live ridership data**. Oslo City Bike, for example, showcases how many riders are currently using the system and how many trips occurred in the past 24 hours. The system also displays metrics like the median trip time and total trip count for the year. This level of transparency and real-time data utilization is unparalleled and a refreshing example of how bikeshare systems can leverage their data.

Despite their leadership in data transparency, Oslo and Bergen could enhance their data accessibility. Implementing an easier process for downloading all data, such as an export option like Austin, an `s3 sync` system like those operated by Lyft, or an API like Toronto's would make their systems even more user friendly for anaylsts.

## A Cities

### Trondheim

<StatsCard city="trondheim" name="Trondheim" />

Trondheim falls just short of the high standards set by Norway's other two cities because it has 983 trips that lack start and end station names. While this is disappointing by Norwegian standards, it is still far better than the data quality of almost all other bikeshare systems. Aside from this minor glitch, Trondheim shares the same high-quality data as Oslo and Bergen.

### Toronto

<StatsCard city="toronto" name="Toronto" />

Toronto is the only city that gives a data quality rating for each of its datasets. As of writing, the bikeshare dataset has a rating of 82%, but let me try to justify its A rating. Credit to Toronto for attempting to rate its data quality. They are the only city I've seen attempt such a self-assessment for all of its open data. As of writing, I was only one of 82 people who watched how Toronto makes [its data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yljTsQkJmP4&ab_channel=CKANAssociation) accessible and measures its quality, but I'm giving the Toronto a 100% rating in their efforts to make data more accessible.

Toronto's data is near perfect, only 22 rows have null station data, and 249 with null end or start times. Given the 22 million total rides, Toronto is also one of the only systems to provide an API to grab the data, using your pick of Python, Node.js, or R. Completeness and Accessibility are responsible for Toronto's high scores.

As for minor flaws, Toronto acknowledges that its data has changed once, but it's not documented how. Developers will need to account for variations in the headers, and
so I had to attempt running the data through code until I found the variations in headers (in this case, only 2). Some Toronto data also have years with only two digits (i.e. 17 instead of 2017). Time formats in Toronto have three different formats ( "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M", "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S", "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M"), and some of their start stations have placeholder characters that required lossy conversion (i.e. Gailbraith Rd / KingG��s College Cr. - this should be King's College Cr.).

### Boston

<StatsCard city="boston" name="Boston" />

"total_rows": 23854295,
"null_rows": 24419,
"percent_null": 0.1,
"updated_at": "2024-10-23 18:50:27"

Highlights:

With less than 0.1% of its trips missing data, Boston's dataset has very few gaps. Downloading all files is a breeze since they, like many of the Lyft owned bikeshare systems, make their data available in an [s3 bucket](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hubway-data/index.html).

Like Boston's streets, the data has a few twists and turns to navigate. A few datetimes are precise to the millisecond, which doesn't play nice with all the other datetimes in seconds. The column headers for the csv files also changed around 2023 and unlike Oslo, however, Boston does not document this change and it's up for the developer to uncover these changes.

In almost all categories Boston is solid, but has some room to improve. On their website, they do share a Boston This nifty [story](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0f5fc6ed107d4c0491d24051eed77ff9) is linked on their data page, and allows users to see how the bikeshare system has grown, and even visualizes popular stations and and destinations by neighborhood.

### Los Angeles and Philadelphia

<StatsCard city="los_angeles" name="Los Angeles" />
<StatsCard city="philadelphia" name="Philadelphia" />

Philadelphia and Los Angeles are both operated by [Bicycle Transit System](https://www.bicycletransit.com/), and both systems have nearly complete data. The data structure for both cities is well documented, and there's one consistent structure for the entire history of data, though there are two datetime formats analysts have to negotiate. Overall, the data is a joy to parse through.

Both cities offer a dashboard that shows the total trips made and passes sold, along with overall benefits including calories burned, miles traveled, and emissions reduced. I wish bikeshare companies would stop project emissions reduced because it's impossible to know whether the person would have just walked, or taken the bus, or not take the trip at all. Alternatively, they should explain how they calculated this emission. Is every trip's estimated miles converted to estimated gas usage? Or are only a certain % of trips included? Perahps it's well intentioned, but it can be very misleading without making the details of the calculation transparent.

This issue does not overshadow that Bicycle Transit Systems has done a great job having high quality data that's complete and easy to process. With their recent (acquisition)[https://www.bicycletransit.com/news/gearing-up-for-growth/] of BCycle and bikeshares in more than 30 cities, I hope they continue to publish quality data for its new cities.

// NTS - Check whether it's due to the misnaming UTF_lossy of one of the station names
The city of cars doesn't have too many bikeshare rides compared to its population or sprawling acreage, but the data it has for its rides is nearly 100% complete. The null data comes from needing to map the station code provided in trip data to a station name. It seems that certain stations no longer can be matched. Even so, over 99.9% of the data is present.

The data structure is well documented, and there's one consistent structure for all of its data. This is likely due to the bikeshare system being always operated by [Bicycle Transit Systems](https://www.bicycletransit.com/our-current-programs/los-angeles/) since its inception in 2016. There are two variations in datetime, but given that there's only one overall set of column headers, the data is still a joy to parse through. I also appreciate how LA explicitly documents how they've processed their data, such as removing trips that are over 24 hours long.

## B Cities

### Austin

<StatsCard city="austin" name="Austin" />

Austin's data is just a bit weird. In terms of the data, it's of the highest of quality - 100% data complete, and a single data structure for straightforward processing. Along with Chattanooga, Austin has the best data download process. One click of an export button, and boom! All the data in a single excel or csv file.

![Austin Export](/images/2024_ratings/austin_export.png)

Austin does make an odd choice of including only start time, and duration (in minutes) rather than the typical start and end time almost all other bikeshare operators use. Maybe they're just trying to live up to their name of making things weird.

What hurts Austin the most is that it stopped updating its data July, 2024, which corresponded to a [switch of operators](https://www.capmetro.org/news/details/2024/02/01/capmetro-ushers-in-a-new-era-for-metrobike-to-improve-austin-s-bike-share-system). We'll see if the new operator, CapMetro, will continue to make bikeshare data available for all.

Maybe remove - Austin's data also can be simplified to reduce file size and download times. They have a column for Checkout Datetime, but also separate Checkout Date and Checkout Time, which are repetitive.

## C Cities

### Taipei

<StatsCard city="taipei" name="Taipei" />

Taipei's data is nearly 100% complete with only 702 trips with missing data. This is incredible considering the over 93 million trips that have been recorded since 2020, the year when Taipei started tracking Youbike 2.0 trips. This is the only historical data that's available, so we're hoping that Taipei will soon share YouBike 1.0 data as well.

One area Taipei falls short is accessing the data. YouBike's [main data page](https://www.youbike.com.tw/region/taipei/operation/) does not reference any data for download. Instead, it's found on the open data page where one can download a single csv. Each row in the csv contains the link to a month of data, so this is a two step process that developers need to hop through to ultimately get monthly data.

Once downloaded, Taipei's data is straightforward to process. One interesting quirk is they provide start time, precise only to the hour, and the duration of the trip, but not the end time. This likely is for privacy reasons, so it's impossible to track where someone ended up if you know their start time. Taipei is the only city that does this, but I can respect the intention even if it makes producing data with consistent data structures across all bikeshares more challenging. What is mildly annoying, however, is the duration is provided in HH:MM:SS format where HH can be over 24, making custom logic necessary for parsing the datetime.

These are mostly minor inconveniences, but what really drags Taipei's quality is the infrequent data updates. In August, 2024, the data had only been updated up to February, 2024. After requesting more data, a government official did respond and provided updated data until June. It seems that data is only updated when it's requested.

### Chattanooga

<StatsCard city="chattanooga" name="Chattanooga" />

Chattanooga might be the smallest city by population that makes its bikeshare data publicly available, so bravo! They use a system similar to Austin's where developers can export all data into a single file at the click of a button. Because the data's in a single file, all data follows the same format for easy download and easy processing. A+ on this front.

Chattanooga fall shorts mostly because its data is very stale. As of November 2024, the last publish date was February 2024, and this data did not only included data up until the end of 2023.

### Montreal

<StatsCard city="montreal" name="Montreal" />

With North America's third largest bikeshare usage (behind New York City and Mexico City), Montreal trips with missing data is middle of the pack. More concerning, however, is that nearly all of the missing data is from recent year data. Prior to 2022, there were only 3 trips that had any missing data. In 2022, that number surged to 74,035 trips, followed by 71,155 trips in 2023, and 49,199 so far in 2024. For 2024, this would mean about 0.6% of trips contained null data.

Parsing through Montreal's bikeshare data is challenging. To start, there are three sets of data structure changes to slog through. In two out of three sets, the start and end station code is provided that needs to be mapped to station name, whereas the most recent data structure directly uses the names. The latest data also uses epoch time for start and end time requiring additional time parsing.

![Bixi Bikeshare Dashboard](/images/2024_ratings/bixi_dashboard.png)

One of Bixi's best features is already visualizing its current year data for visitors, even allowing users to explore different aspects, such as comparing purchases vs trips, and trips made by members vs one off users. Visitors can also switch the year to see how the trips have changed over time. Nice!

### New York City and Jersey City

<StatsCard city="nyc" name="New York City" />
<StatsCard city="jersey_city" name="Jersey City" />

New York City and Jersey City data are all available in the same S3 bucket for download. While overall the data completeness is high, all the missing data has come after 2020, perhaps coinciding with Lyft taking over operations from Motivate. Just as concerning is that for certain months in 2013 and 2018, there are files that are duplicated so certain trips are counted twice. Note the larger file sizes of 2013 and 2018 compared to subsequent years in the image below.

![NYC Odd Data](/images/2024_ratings/nyc_weird_data.png)

For NYC, processing the data requires handling three separate data structures, and three time formats, but otherwise is straightforward. Jersey City only uses one time format across all of its three different data structures, making the process a little simpler.

Bells and whistles wise, New York City's bikeshare data has a couple of cool features, such as sharing the [monthly operating costs](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data/operating-reports), NYC's more general [biking data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#Bikes), and finally a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/citibike-hackers) one can join to meet other bikeshare data enthusiasts.

### Washington DC

<StatsCard city="dc" name="Washintgon DC" />

Washington DC data has even more gaps than New York City's, and like NYC, most of it missing data comes after 2020, spiking to over 1 million trips with missing start or end station names in 2024. DC's data is easier to process than NYC's with only two data structures, and only one time format.

## D Cities

### Mexico City

<StatsCard city="mexico_city" name="Mexico City" />

Mexico City really should belong in the C tier based on its data completeness, but its data is miserable to process. It's common for cities two have two or three sets of data structures, each corresponding to a time of a particular operator. Mexico City, however, has data with headers that have columns that have minor variations, or even typos. For example, the arrival date (fecha arribo), is sometimes labeled as: Fecha_Arribo, Fecha_arribo, or Fecha Arribo. In the June 2021 file, there were two identical headers of Hora_Arribo, but one was intended to be Hora_Retiro.

With so many variations, it makes sense Mexico City doesn't attempt to document these variations. Developers are on their own to iron out the quirks in the data.

### Chicago and Columbus

<StatsCard city="chicago" name="Chicago" />
<StatsCard city="columbus" name="Columbus" />

Processing Chicago data starts off great with a simple S3 bucket sync, but it quickly goes downhill from there.

Prior to 2020, Chicago's bikeshare rarely had any missing data values. Perhaps coinciding with Lyft's takeover in 2019, the data quality drastically declined. Now every month, the data has gaps in data, sometimes missing start or end station names, sometimes both. The result is over 11% of Chicago's data having missing information.

To parse the data, Chicago has three different data structures in tis csv files, including one truly baffling set, which includes column headers formatted like "01 - Rental Details Local Start Time". Adding to the pain, Chicago's time columns comes in four different flavors ("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S", "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M","%Y-%m-%d %H:%M").

Columbus performs slightly better than Chicago with less than 10% of its trips missing data, and has only two variations in dateteime, making it slightly simpler to process. These minor improvements, however, are not enough to bump into the the C tier.

### San Francisco

<StatsCard city="sf" name="San Francisco" />

Not to be outdone by the windy city, Fog City makes its data even harder to parse as 1 in 5 trips have either missing start or end station (or both). The data spotiness covers up any other redeeming qualities of the data, which otherwise shares many of the nice accessibility and usability features of its US Lyft operated peers.
